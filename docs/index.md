This is the current command list for Seedy Bot.

Important Stuff You Should Know:
--------------------------------

1. Seedy Bot primarily uses the command character `-`.
2. `[ ]` text enclosed in brackets means that it is a necessary argument/option, and must be specified **always**.
3. `( )` text enclosed in parenthesis means that it is optional, and the command would work regardless it was specified or not, albeit in a different manner, to be more specific, it'd resort to the _default_ options.
4. All of the commands mentioned below are to be **preceded by `-`**, for Seedy Bot to recognize them as commands.
